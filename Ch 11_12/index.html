    <h1>PIAIC</h1>
    <h2>Presidential Initiative
        for Artificial Intelligence And Computing</h2>
        <p>
            The mission of PIAIC is to reshape Pakistan 
            by revolutionizing education, research, and 
            business by adopting latest, cutting-edge technologies. 
            Experts are calling this the 4th industrial revolution. 
            We want Pakistan to become a global hub for AI, data 
            science, cloud native computing, edge computing, blockchain, 
            augmented reality, and internet of things.

        <h3 id="cnc"><span>C</span>loud Native Computing:</h3>
        <p> The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the 
            students to program in open source
            technologies like, <b><i>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, 
            JavaScript, Node.js, React and Reack Native.</i></b> 
            while introducing the students to development of
            Microservices and software development techniques
            on cloud platforms like AWS. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 id="ai"><span>A</span>rtificial Intelligence:</h3>
        <p> The <b>artificial intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes 
            the student through the foundation of AI technology, via
            teaching programming in open source languages like, 
            <b><i>Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</i></b> 
            and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use,
            cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day
            AI in practice.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 id="bc"><span>B</span>lockchain:</h3>
        <p> The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand like, 
            <b><i>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric),</i></b> 
            and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript
            on frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them
            to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like
            Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain -as-a-service (BaaS)
            and how to develop and offer an initial Coin Offering (ICo) of a crypto-token.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 id="iot"><span>I</span>nternet of Things:</h3>
        <p> The <b>Internet of Things</b> program introduces the students to
            open source development like, <b><i>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly,
            Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</i></b> 
            while making them efficient in developing Microservices for IoT Edge, IoT 
            Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
